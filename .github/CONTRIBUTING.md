# How to Contribute

We welcome any kind of contributions. Whether you are reporting a bug, coding a feature or correcting a typo. Every effort counts; and all contributions are greatly appreaciated.

Another great way to contribute is to actually use Rust Starter for your Open Source or Commercial projects. If you do, make sure to open an issue with a link to your project. In the future, there will be a list of applications bootstrapped with Rust Starter.

### Testing Code

To run all tests, run the following command.

```sh
cargo test --all

```

Alternatively, if you have [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) installed you can run the prebuilt recipes. *Not* using `just` is perfectly fine as well, it simply bundles commands automatically.

For example, to test the code, as above simply run:

```sh
$ just run-tests
```

### Linting Code

### Debugging Code

### Commit Messages

Use a [conventional](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/a5505865ff3dd710cf757f50530e73ef0ca641da/conventions/angular.md) changelog format so the changelog can be updated automatically using [clog](https://github.com/clog-tool/clog-cli)

 * Please format your commit subject line using the following format: `TYPE(COMPONENT): MESSAGE` where `TYPE` is one of the following:
    - `feat` - A new feature of an existing API
    - `imp`  - An improvement to an existing feature/API
    - `perf` - A performance improvement
    - `docs` - Changes to documentation only
    - `tests` - Changes to the testing framework or tests only
    - `fix` - A bug fix
    - `refactor` - Code functionality doesn't change, but underlying structure may
    - `style` - Stylistic changes only, no functionality changes
    - `wip` - A work in progress commit (Should typically be `git rebase`'ed away)
    - `chore` - Catch all or things that have to do with the build system, etc
    - `examples` - Changes to existing example, or a new example
 * The `COMPONENT` is optional, and may be a single file, directory, or logical component. Parenthesis can be omitted if you are opting not to use the `COMPONENT`.

### Tests and Documentation

1. Create tests for your changes
2. **Ensure the tests are passing.** Run the tests (`cargo test --all`), alternatively `just run-tests` if you have `just` installed.
3. **Optional** Run the lints.
4. Ensure your changes contain documentation if adding new APIs or features.

### Preparing the PR


1. `git rebase` into concise commits and remove `--fixup`s or `wip` commits (`git rebase -i HEAD~NUM` where `NUM` is number of commits back to start the rebase)
2. Push your changes back to your fork (`git push origin $your-branch`)
3. Create a pull request against `master`! (You can also create the pull request first, and we'll merge when ready. This a good way to discuss proposed changes.)

### Goals

* Remain backwards compatible when possible.
    Backward compatibility is not critical since projects do not depend on Rust Starter. But it's a good idea to have stable features and usage.
* Reduce dependencies.
* Follow best practices.
* Ease of use and customization.
